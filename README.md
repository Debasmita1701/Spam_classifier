# Spam_classifier
Built a model which classifies whether the given message is Spam or not. The model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a Kaggle dataset containing text messages that are classified into two categories: Spam and Ham (non-spam). It includes a total of 5,572 entries, each with a message and its corresponding label.

# Library Used

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical computations.

matplotlib: For data visualization.

seaborn: For enhanced visualization.

pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.

flask: For creating the web interface.

# Web Interface

The project also includes a web interface where a user can input a message, and the model will classify it as either "Spam" or "Ham".

# Accuracy of the model

he model achieved an accuracy of 97%. This means that the model correctly classified 97% of the messages in the dataset as either spam or not.


# Steps to run the project 

First clone the project 

Run the spam_detect.py file

Run the spam_application.py file 

We will forwarded to browser where you will see an input form .You can enter an message and the model will classify it
